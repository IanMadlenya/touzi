# Relax

A data-driven asset allocation, long-only stock portfolio. This project is a set of scripts to help me choose Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) to hold in my UK Stocks ISA and Canadian RRSP accounts. The goal is to keep up with each contries' long-term market expected return while exposed to statistically significantly less volatility than FTSE100 or TSX60 in each account, respectively.

This project is made available for informational purpose only and should not be construed as investment advice.
