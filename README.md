# Touzi

A data-driven asset allocation, long-only stock portfolio maker. This project is a set of scripts to help me choose Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) to hold in my UK Stocks ISA and Canadian RRSP accounts.

Touzi recommends ETFs to watch for asset allocation to optimise non-systematic risks and do not provide any alpha strategy or trading logic.
