A data-driven asset allocation, long-only stock portfolio maker. This project is a set of scripts to help me choose Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) to hold in my UK Stocks ISA and Canadian RRSP accounts.

This project merely recommends ETFs to watch for asset allocation to optimise non-systematic risks and do not provide any alpha strategy or market timing logic.

Furthermore, this project is made available for informational purpose only and should not be construed as investment advice.
